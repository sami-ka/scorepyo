.. py:class:: EBMBinarizer(max_number_binaries_by_features: int = 2, keep_negative: bool = True)

   Class for automatic feature binarizer based on EBM.

   This class uses Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) that are part of the General Additive Model (GAM) family.
   EBM will compute for each feature a tree. The final prediction will be made by summing up the tree value for each feature.
   Since it's single-feature tree, it actually is a piecewise constant scalar function.
   For each interval where the single-feature tree yields a constant contribution for the prediction, this class computes a binary feature.

   Attributes
   ----------
   max_number_binaries_by_features : int
       maximum number of binary features to compute by feature
   keep_negative : bool
       indicator to keep features that decrease predicted probability
   _ebm: ExplainableBoostingClassifier
       EBM classifier that is fitted and used to binarize feature
   _one_hot_encoder: OneHotEncoder
       Scikit-learn one-hot encoder for categorical features
   _categorical_features: list(str)
       list of categorical features
   _continuous_features: list(str)
       list of continuous features
   _to_exclude_features: list(str)
       list of features to exclude from binarizing


   Methods
   -------
   fit(X, y, categorical_features="auto", to_exclude_features=None))
       fits the EBM model on X,y and the one-hot encoder on the categorical features

   transform(X)
       transforms features in X into binarized features based on previously fitted EBM and one-hot encoder

   .. py:method:: fit(X: pandas.DataFrame, y: pandas.Series, categorical_features: Union[list[str], str] = 'auto', to_exclude_features: Optional[list[str]] = None)

      Fit function of binarizer

      This functions fits the EBM on X,y and the one-hot encoder on X.
      It stores the categorical, continuous and to exclude columns.

      Args:
          X (pandas.Dataframe): Dataframe of features to use to fit the binarizer
          y (pandas.Series): target values
          categorical_features (list(str), optional): list of categorical features to one-hot encode.
          Defaults to "auto" to automatically detect categorical features.
          to_exclude_features (list(str), optional): List of features to leave as is.
          Defaults to None.


   .. py:method:: transform(X: pandas.DataFrame) -> pandas.DataFrame


   .. py:method:: transform_old(X: pandas.DataFrame) -> tuple[pandas.DataFrame, pandas.DataFrame]

      Transform function of binarizer

      This function uses the previously fitted EBM to extract binary features from continuous features.
      For each continuous feature, it looks at each constructed interval to create a binary feature based on feature value belonging to this interval or not.
      For categorical features, it uses the one-hot encoder previously fitted.
      For features to exclude from the binarizer, it copies the values in the new dataset.

      Args:
          X (pandas.DataFrame): Dataframe of features to transform

      Returns:
          pandas.DataFrame: Binarized features
          pandas.DataFrame: DataFrame of information of binary feature and corresponding feature


   .. py:method:: get_info() -> pandas.DataFrame
